= IMPORTANT

The woas-0.12.0 files are old and can corrupt data in some browsers. Please use
the woas-fix.html file instead. There is more information in that file.

= Wiki on a Stick

Wiki on a Stick (WoaS) is a personal wiki that lives in one self-modifying
XHTML containing software, interface and data. Very useful for creating small
websites and mantaining notes or todo-lists; completely javascript-
programmable, supports images and files embedding.

= Installation instructions

WoaS needs a modern javascript-capable browser, currently supported browsers
are:

- Firefox (Gecko-based, all versions)
- Internet Explorer (6.0 and above) *
- Chrome and Safari (AppleWebkit-based) **
- Opera **

You can't use WoaS with javascript disabled.

* = Renaming woas.html to woas.hta might help with file permissions errors in
more recent versions of IE

** = You will need java applets to exploit file loading/saving features for
browsers like Chrome, Safari and Opera.

TiddlySaver.jar is the java applet used in such cases (borrowed from
TiddlyWiki project); if you do not need TiddlySaver.jar feature, you can remove
it.

In order to start WoaS, open the woas-*.html file, which contains the software
and the default pages.

= Usage

WoaS contains all the necessary documentation in its help pages.

= Plugins

WoaS comes with some officially supported plugins, you can find them in
the 'plugins/' directory.

Some plugins (those based on 3rd-party libraries) require that you download
the relative library in order to work; you can find the download location URL
in the GETME files dropped into plugins' empty directories.

You can import a plugin by importing the relative WSIF file, see documentation
for more information.

= Macros

WoaS comes with some sample macros which can be found in 'macros/' directory.

= Removal instructions

Delete the files you extracted from the release archive.
